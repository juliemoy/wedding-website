                <p class="about--michelle-info">Michelle was born in Puerto Rico, graduated from high school in London, moved to New York City for college and never left. In fact, she has been in the same apartment in Brooklyn for the past 14 years. She loves animals of all kinds, coffee at all temperatures, and has an extensive and thoroughly catalogued record collection. Michelle loves Julie for her wit, her charm, and her grace under pressure, but mostly for her upper-body strength. Michelle really only likes vanilla ice cream.</p> 
                <img class="about--julie-image" alt="julie with a bow on her head" src="../assets/images/about/julie-5.jpg">
                <p class="about--julie-info">Julie grew up on Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill, NY, went to college in Vermont, and has been living and working in New York City since 2014. She loves sports, crossword puzzles, and stovetop espresso, and has eaten a bowl of oatmeal nearly every day of her life. She loves Michelle for her boldness and exuberance, her incredible thoughtfulness, and her fierce determination when she sets her mind to something. But mostly she just loves the way Michelle makes her feel, which is loved, supported, and cared for. Julie likes mint chocolate chip ice cream and also raspberry with chocolate sprinkles.</p>
